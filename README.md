# MindmachineOF
Openframeworks Mindmachine with Arduino-Goggle support.

Inspired by Mitch Altman's DIY Mindmachine (http://makezine.com/2008/11/13/the-brain-machine/) this oF project aims to recreate a computer driven Mindmachine in order to generate and experiment with different binaural tracks.

# Arduino Goggles
You can build your own Goggles like these ones: http://blog.lincomatic.com/?p=993 and connect them to an Arduino. See my newer project on https://github.com/cpietsch/BrainEdit for the PIN layout.
